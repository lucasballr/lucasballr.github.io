      <description>This challenge gave you a qasm file which creates a quantum circuit. This circuit was designed to just output a 1 or a 0 depending on the position. All you had to do was read the superposition of the qubits and the resulting string would be a bunch of 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s that translate to the ascii version of the flag. It helped to run these things one at a time cause some stuff took extra time so I did it in a jupyter notebook.</description>

      <description>This was basically a flag scrambler/checker that would run in 8 different processes. The binary required there to be 8 processes in order to run correctly because it would use inter-process communication.&#xA;Essentially it would take your input, and jumble it using a key and just swap bytes in weird places. This was easily reversable. Then it would user openMPI to send your jumbled input in 8 byte sections to the 8 different processes.</description>
