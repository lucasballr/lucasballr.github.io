      <description>How did we get here? Link to heading It started with a random tryout with the OSUSEC club to see who might be eligible to compete in the competition. This ended with me getting my spot on the team learning anything I can about cyber defence. I had been working on binary exploitation at the time, so I had no idea what to expect for this. They told me to look up the best ways to secure a wordpress site as well as an nginx site.</description>

      <description>Okay so I&amp;rsquo;m writing this two years after the fact, but I figured I&amp;rsquo;d talk about my experience. The 2024 version is much more in-depth than this one.&#xA;Why would I do this? Link to heading I essentially was trying to look into ways to get back into the whole hacker / computer science space and decided to look into OSUSEC again. I had originally joined the discord server in 2017 because I had an interest in cyber, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have the guidance/motivation to participate.</description>
