      <description>How it started Link to heading I initially started my homelab with the intention to get a network-wide adblock set up for my network. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like having to look at ads everywhere I went on the internet. I decided to install pi-hole on an old raspberry pi. This is what fueled my need for MORE! From there I found the /r/homelab subreddit and /r/selfhosted subreddit. These forums helped me figure out what to do with my homelab.</description>
