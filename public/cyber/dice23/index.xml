      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was basically a flag scrambler/checker that would run in 8 different&#xA;processes. The binary required there to be 8 processes in order to run correctly&#xA;because it would use inter-process communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially it would take your input, and jumble it using a key and just swap bytes&#xA;in weird places. This was easily reversable. Then it would user openMPI to send your&#xA;jumbled input in 8 byte sections to the 8 different processes. Then these processes&#xA;went in a loop 10000 times sending a byte at a certain index to the next process. These&#xA;processes were essentially rotating the bytes in a circle between processes. So it looked&#xA;kinda like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This challenge gave you a qasm file which creates a quantum circuit.&#xA;This circuit was designed to just output a 1 or a 0 depending on the position.&#xA;All you had to do was read the superposition of the qubits and the resulting&#xA;string would be a bunch of 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s that translate to the ascii version of&#xA;the flag. It helped to run these things one at a time cause some stuff took extra&#xA;time so I did it in a jupyter notebook. Here&amp;rsquo;s the script:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
